To use any snippet, either:
	(In Sublime Text)
		Go to 'Tools' > 'New Snippet',
		copy and paste the file contents in to the new snippet and save (with the 'sublime-snippet' extension)

or:
	find the directory that Sublime looks in for snippets (an easy way to do this is create a new empty snippet and make note of the file ST tries to save this to.)
	For me it's Users > Me > Library > Application Support > Sublime Text 2 > Packages > User
	so 'open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/' would open this directory in finder... then you can just copy and paste away!
